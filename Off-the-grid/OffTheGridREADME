Off the Grid Code Sim

Background:
You've been attending the Off The Grid food truck festival every Friday for the last few months.
In order to better optimize your experience, you've been tracking wait times, cost, and tastiness
of the food you've tried from week to week. (You don't try the same set of foods each week.) For simplicity assume that each stand sells only one
dish and that the dish hasn't changed over time.


Objective:
Write a program that analyzes and makes predictions using the food truck data. Choose whatever
language you like to produce a solution to all three milestones in an hour.


Hints:
-- This is an open-book simulation; feel free to use the internet and to ask for help.
-- There are multiple ways to solve each milestone. Especially for milestone 3, choose the best
   (i.e. approximate or exact) solution you can implement in the time remaining.
-- Exception handling, formatting and documentation are all secondary to creating a working solution.


Input Data:
You are provided a CSV, OffTheGridData.csv, in the following format:
Stand Number, Week Number, Price (Dollars), Wait Time (Minutes), Tastiness (1-10)


Milestones:

1) How much money have you spent in total at Off the Grid?

2) What stand had the biggest increase in wait times between two sequential visits? Over what weeks did this
   occur and what was the increase?

3) Given the following time constraints, produce a list of stands to visit that maximizes tastiness.
   Assume that you will wait the mean time and receive mean tastiness from each stand. Output a
   set of stands to visit, total time used, and total tastiness acquired. You cannot visit the same
   stand more than once in each situation.

	a) You have no plans for the evening, and have 45 minutes to get food.
	b) You are going to a really good movie after Off the Grid. You have only 20 minutes.
